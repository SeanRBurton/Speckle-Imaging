Speckle-Imaging
===============

A python script for analysis of laser speckle images for the determination of the roughness of surfaces. Running 'analysis.py' with python 2.x will grab all '.TIF' files from the current

working directory and log their 'speckle contrast' (see e.g. Dunn, A. K. Laser speckle contrast imaging in biomedical optics. Journal of Biomedical Optics, 011109.) values in the file 'digest.csv'.
